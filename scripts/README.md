Scripts

run_basic_scenes.py
- Builds example simulations for simple_chat, council, werewolf, landlord, village.
- Also demonstrates ControlledOrdering logic for landlord (via scene state).

dev_ui_streamlit.py (legacy) / simtree_ui_streamlit.py (legacy)
- Early prototypes of a UI. Use the web DevUI instead.

static/snapshot_viewer.html
- Minimal snapshot viewer for saved states/logs.

Tips
- Prefer the DevUI web app for running and inspecting simulations.
- The builders in run_basic_scenes.py are used by the DevUI backendâ€™s create endpoint.
