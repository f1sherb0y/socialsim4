## Version 3.0 — Core Systems Rebuild

SocialSim4 3.0 refocuses the platform on being an LLM-driven social simulation framework for causal experimentation. The release rebuilds the core around strict Agent/Action/Event/Scene boundaries so every interaction is traceable and reproducible.

### Highlights
- All-new architecture: agents reason, plan, and decide entirely via LLM calls; actions are the only way to touch the environment; events carry every effect across the system.
- Scenes replace legacy templates with a compact interface that defines rules, prompts, and event routing while the simulator handles turn orchestration.
- Action space: each action derives from a strict base class, enabling plug-and-play mixes of shared actions (for example `send_message`) and scene-locked actions (`open_voting`, `play_card`).
- Simulation Tree (SimTree): capture full simulator state at any node, branch timelines, replay interventions, and stream run logs for counterfactual analysis.

### Scheduling & Agent Runtime
- Custom ordering strategies: sequential, cycled, random, controlled, and LLM-moderated flows now coexist, letting moderators queue agents dynamically with `schedule_order`.
- Agents deliver richer, context-aware dialogue, support multi-action turns, and run roughly 4× faster (≈15s per round). Clearer action/event logs drastically reduce post-run debugging.

### Scene Library
- Refined scenes: Simple Chat, Legislative Council, and Village scenes adopt the new interface, enabling chained actions, procedural rules, and locality-aware conversations.
- New scenes: Werewolf (moderator-managed social deduction with `open_voting`/`close_voting`) and Landlord Poker (strict turn-based card play with scoring and enforcement).

### Development Experience
- Development UI now streams per-node deltas over WebSocket, cutting payload sizes and making long simulations easier to inspect in real time.

### Breaking Changes
- 3.0 is not backward compatible with 2.x simulations. Every run must target the Scene/Action/Event APIs introduced in this release.

### Sample Scenario
- The bundled Legislative Council run demonstrates nuanced policy debate, moderator-driven agenda control, and auditable event logs across speeches, votes, and scheduling.

## Version 2.0 — Interaction Refinements

**Released:** 2025-06-16

Version 2.0 focused on speeding up iteration and making agent runs easier to configure and review.

### New Capabilities
- One-click summary button on simulation results pages for rapid post-run reviews.
- Agent bootstrap from `.txt` and similar config files, auto-generating multi-agent setups.
- Emotion display module overlays core affect states during inference for a more legible UX.
- Per-user persistence for multiple LLM API endpoints (chat, generation, embeddings) with automatic reuse on future runs.
- Published end-to-end user guide covering setup, simulation workflows, and troubleshooting.
