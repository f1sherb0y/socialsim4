[send_message] Host: Good evening, esteemed members of the legislative council. We are convened today to deliberate on the Draft Ordinance: Urban Air Quality and Congestion Management (Pilot).

To briefly summarize, this draft proposes a 12-month congestion charge pilot in the Central Business District, active on weekdays from 07:00 to 19:00 with dynamic pricing starting at 30 CNY per entry. Exemptions are provided for public buses, emergency vehicles, and disability permit holders, with a 50% discount for registered residents within the zone. All generated revenue is to be ring-fenced for public transit upgrades, bike lanes, and air-quality programs, with quarterly audits. The ordinance mandates monthly public dashboards for transparency on air quality and traffic metrics, and camera-based enforcement with strict privacy controls. An independent evaluation at 12 months will assess success based on concrete criteria, guiding the council's decision to terminate, modify, or expand the pilot.

We will now proceed to opening remarks. I invite members to offer concise statements, limited to three minutes each, regarding the draft.
[send_message] Rep. Chen Wei: Thank you, Host, and good evening to my esteemed colleagues.

I have reviewed the Draft Ordinance for Urban Air Quality and Congestion Management, and I must say, it presents a pragmatic and well-structured approach to addressing critical urban challenges. As a representative for our downtown professionals, I see significant value in its core tenets.

Firstly, this ordinance's commitment to a 12-month pilot program, complete with explicit success criteria—specifically a 15% traffic reduction and a 10% PM2.5 reduction—is precisely the kind of evidence-based policy-making we should champion. It allows us to gather verifiable data, learn from implementation, and make informed decisions about its future. This systematic evaluation mitigates risk and ensures accountability.

Secondly, the proposal's fiscal responsibility is commendable. The ring-fencing of all generated revenue for public transit upgrades, bike lanes, and air-quality programs is a direct investment back into our urban infrastructure and citizens' well-being. This ensures transparency and dedicates funds to where they are most needed, addressing the downtown's mobility and environmental concerns directly.

While any new charge presents adjustments, the provisions for exemptions and the 50% resident discount demonstrate a thoughtful effort towards balancing the immediate impact with the long-term benefits of cleaner air and more efficient transit—ultimately enhancing the quality of life and business environment in our CBD.

I look forward to discussing its implementation details, but at this juncture, I express my strong support for advancing this pilot ordinance.
[send_message] Rep. Li Na: Thank you, Host, and good evening, esteemed colleagues. I appreciate the intent behind this Draft Ordinance on Urban Air Quality and Congestion Management. The goals of reducing traffic, improving our city's air quality, and channeling revenue into public transit and bike infrastructure are indeed vital for a sustainable, healthy future for all residents. I commend the provisions for a pilot program and the independent evaluation, which are essential for evidence-based policymaking.

However, as a representative deeply committed to equity and affordability, I must express specific concerns regarding the proposed congestion charge. While I support measures to curb pollution and alleviate congestion, we must ensure these initiatives do not disproportionately burden our low-income workers and families. A base fee of 30 CNY, with dynamic pricing, could represent a significant financial strain for those who may not have viable public transit alternatives or who rely on private vehicles for essential work and care responsibilities.

We must scrutinize the definition of exemptions and discounts. While residents within the CBD receive a discount, what about low-income commuters who live outside the zone but work essential jobs within it, or those who must drive due to limited public transit access? It is imperative that we implement robust safeguards to protect these vulnerable populations from undue financial hardship.

For this pilot to truly succeed and be equitable, we must prioritize significant, tangible enhancements to public transit *before* or *concurrently with* the full impact of any charge. People need reliable, affordable alternatives. The ring-fencing of revenue is excellent, but we need assurances that these transit upgrades will truly serve those most impacted by new charges and that they are ready when needed.

Let us advance this ordinance with a strong, principled commitment to both environmental improvement and social justice, ensuring that the burden and the benefits are shared fairly across all segments of our community. I look forward to ensuring these critical equity considerations are addressed thoroughly.
[send_message] Rep. Zhang Rui: Thank you, Host. My colleagues have raised valid points on both sides, the ambition to improve our city's air and traffic is something we all share. However, I have serious reservations about this particular approach, especially the proposed congestion charge.

From the perspective of our small business owners and the everyday drivers who keep our economy moving, this ordinance feels less like an incentive and more like a punitive tax. A 30 CNY base fee, potentially higher with dynamic pricing, is a direct hit to the bottom line for many small businesses. Think about deliveries, service calls, or even just customers trying to access shops in the CBD. Are we ready to tell them their trade will now cost extra?

And what about the average driver? Not everyone has the luxury of public transit that works for their schedule or their family needs. This charge essentially penalizes them for needing to get to work or conduct essential business. It adds another layer of cost to simply participating in our city's economy.

Moreover, while the idea of camera-based enforcement and dynamic pricing sounds advanced, I foresee an administrative nightmare. We're talking about setting up a complex system of monitoring, billing, exemptions, and discounts. What are the overhead costs of this bureaucracy? How many erroneous charges will small businesses and individuals have to fight? We've seen similar systems in other cities become bogged down in complexity and complaints.

My concern is that we're creating new burdens, hiking costs, and adding red tape, all while risking pushing traffic and pollution to other areas, or worse, driving businesses and customers away from the CBD entirely. Let's make sure we're considering the *full* picture of impact, not just ideal outcomes, before we rush into something that could have significant unintended consequences for the backbone of our community.
[send_message] Rep. Zhang Rui: Rep. Wang, I appreciate the optimism you bring regarding a cleaner, more attractive CBD. Who wouldn't want that? But we need to be realistic about *how* we achieve it, and at what cost to whom.

Suggesting that a congestion charge will magically bring in more customers because the air is cleaner ignores the immediate, tangible barrier it creates. For many small businesses, their customers are not tourists looking for an aesthetic experience; they're locals, workers, and people needing everyday services. If every delivery, every service vehicle, every customer visit now costs an extra 30 CNY or more, that's not an *investment* for small businesses; it's a new operational expense, a hurdle for their clientele.

We can talk all we want about future liveability, but if we price out the small shops, the mechanics, the family-run restaurants, and the delivery drivers in the process, then what kind of "vibrant heart" are we left with? A city needs its small businesses to thrive, and adding another fee directly undermines their ability to do so. This isn't just theory; it's practical economics that directly impacts livelihoods. A 'pilot' year still means a year of genuine hardship for those directly affected.
[send_message] Rep. Zhang Rui: Rep. Qiao, I appreciate you acknowledging the burden on small businesses and drivers. That's a critical part of this discussion. But let's be clear: for many, driving into the CBD isn't a "choice" they make lightly; it's a necessity for their livelihood.

If you're a plumber, an electrician, a caterer making deliveries, or a small shop owner relying on vehicle access for supplies and customers, that 30 CNY isn't an option to choose public transit. It's an unavoidable operating cost. This isn't about convenience; it's about making a living.

And while we all want better public transport, those improvements aren't magically going to appear overnight alongside this charge. People need *tangible, reliable alternatives already in place* before we impose significant new costs. We can't ask small businesses and ordinary citizens to pay more now on the promise that *maybe* transit will catch up later. That's a burden they can't afford, especially during a pilot where the benefits are still unproven but the costs are immediate and concrete.

[send_message] Rep. Wang Mei: Thank you, Host. Esteemed colleagues. The goals of improved air quality and reduced congestion are certainly commendable for our city's future.

However, as the representative for our commercial districts, my primary concern lies with the direct economic impact this pilot could have on our local businesses, particularly small merchants and critical delivery logistics. A base fee of 30 CNY, with dynamic pricing, introduces an immediate and unpredictable operating cost. For businesses relying on deliveries, service calls, or customer access, this isn't just an inconvenience; it's a direct hit to their bottom line, risking their competitiveness and viability.

We must ensure that while we aim for a greener city, we don't inadvertently stifle the very businesses that make our economy thrive. I urge the council to consider specific, predictable exemptions or substantial discounts for commercial vehicles essential for business operations—delivery services, trade vehicles, and small business owners—to mitigate undue financial burden. Their capacity to operate efficiently and affordably is critical for a vibrant CBD.
[send_message] Rep. Qiao Jun: Thank you, Host, and good evening, esteemed colleagues. I rise in strong support of the Draft Ordinance on Urban Air Quality and Congestion Management. This is precisely the bold, decisive action our city requires to tackle two of its most pressing issues: deteriorating air quality and debilitating traffic congestion.

The health of our citizens and the sustainability of our urban environment demand nothing less than ambitious policy, and this ordinance delivers. The proposal’s commitment to a 12-month pilot, with specific, measurable environmental targets—a 10% reduction in PM2.5 levels—and the comprehensive framework for transparent monitoring, public dashboards, and independent evaluation directly addresses the need for evidence-based governance. This ensures accountability and allows us to adapt based on verifiable data, making it a responsible and analytically sound approach.

We must acknowledge that rapid emissions reduction and improvements in air quality yield immense long-term benefits: reduced healthcare costs, increased productivity, and a higher quality of life for all residents. The ring-fencing of revenue for public transit upgrades, bike lanes, and further air-quality programs is not merely a funding mechanism; it’s a strategic reinvestment in a healthier, more efficient city infrastructure that will ultimately benefit everyone, including businesses and commuters.

While concerns regarding economic impact and equity are valid and must be carefully managed, they should not deter us from pursuing these crucial environmental objectives. This pilot, with its resident discounts and exemptions, coupled with the dedicated funding for public transit improvements, provides mechanisms to mitigate these challenges. It is imperative that we implement these transit upgrades swiftly and effectively, ensuring viable alternatives become readily available.

This ordinance is a foundational step towards a greener, more breathable, and more sustainable urban future. I urge my colleagues to view this not as an imposition, but as a critical investment in the well-being of our city and its people. Let us move forward with resolve to improve our air quality and set a new standard for transparent environmental governance. Thank you.
[send_message] Rep. Qiao Jun: Rep. Zhang, I appreciate your persistent advocacy for small businesses and your concern for the immediate operational costs. It is undeniable that a shift of this magnitude involves adjustments. However, we must consider the full scope of costs – both explicit and implicit.

The "unavoidable operating cost" you refer to is, in many ways, the cost of previously externalized pollution and congestion that has burdened our city's air and public health for too long. This ordinance proposes to internalize those costs, yes, but crucially, it dedicates *every single cent* of that revenue directly into public transit upgrades and air quality programs. This is not a tax that vanishes into general coffers; it is an immediate, self-funding mechanism to rapidly construct the very alternatives you rightly say are needed. Public transit improvements *will* accelerate because of this charge, not independent of it.

Furthermore, let us not ignore the existing costs to businesses from poor air quality and congestion: employee health issues leading to lost productivity, delayed deliveries, and a less attractive, less vibrant CBD that deters both customers and talent. These are tangible, economic impacts that are often overlooked until they become critical.

This is a pilot program for a reason, Rep. Zhang. It allows us to gather precise data on economic impacts, traffic shifts, and crucially, the effectiveness of the mitigating investments in transit. This allows us to make informed adjustments rather than abandoning the critical goal of a healthier, more economically resilient city. Inaction carries its own, far higher, and often invisible, price tag.
[send_message] Host: Thank you, representatives, for your initial statements.

Rep. Chen Wei and Rep. Qiao Jun have expressed strong support, highlighting the evidence-based pilot nature, the clear success criteria, the ring-fencing of revenue for public transit and air quality, and the overall benefit to urban health and sustainability. Rep. Qiao further emphasized the internalization of pollution costs and the acceleration of transit improvements through dedicated funding.

Conversely, Rep. Li Na and Rep. Zhang Rui have raised significant concerns. Rep. Li Na underscored the importance of equity and affordability, questioning the potential burden on low-income workers and those without viable public transit alternatives, and stressed the need for robust safeguards and concurrent transit enhancements. Rep. Zhang Rui focused on the economic impact on small businesses and everyday drivers, viewing the charge as punitive, predicting administrative challenges, and fearing businesses and customers might be driven away. Rep. Wang Mei also articulated concerns about the direct economic impact on small merchants and logistics, requesting specific exemptions or substantial discounts for commercial vehicles.

The core tension appears to be between the necessity of addressing urban air quality and congestion for long-term health and sustainability, and the immediate economic and social equity impacts of the proposed congestion charge.

I now open the floor for further discussion and exchange among members. Please ensure your contributions remain focused and respect the time of the council.
[send_message] Rep. Chen Wei: Thank you, Host, and to my colleagues for these insightful remarks. I understand and appreciate the concerns raised by Reps. Li Na, Zhang Rui, and Wang Mei regarding affordability and the potential impact on small businesses and essential workers. These are indeed critical considerations for any urban policy.

However, I believe we must view this Draft Ordinance through the lens of a *pilot program*. This isn't a permanent, immediately irreversible system. It is a carefully designed experiment, with a clear 12-month duration and stringent, independently verified success criteria.

Rep. Zhang Rui, you spoke of economic impact and administrative nightmares. This pilot is specifically designed to provide us with empirical data on *precisely* these factors. How much does traffic truly reduce? What is the actual impact on PM2.5 levels? And, yes, what are the observed economic shifts and operational challenges? The monthly public dashboards and the independent evaluation are not just bureaucratic hurdles; they are our tools to understand the *real* costs and benefits, not just speculative ones.

The ring-fencing of revenue for public transit improvements and air quality programs is also a fundamental mitigating factor. Rep. Li Na, your point about needing tangible transit enhancements *concurrently* is very well taken. This funding mechanism ensures that the increased cost for some drivers directly contributes to building robust alternatives—alternatives that will eventually alleviate the very dependency on private vehicles that currently concerns us. This is a self-funding path to improved equity through better public infrastructure.

We must consider the significant, often invisible, economic burden that current congestion and poor air quality already place on our downtown businesses. Lost productivity from employees suffering health issues, delayed logistics, and a less attractive urban core all have tangible costs. This pilot offers a pathway to a more efficient, healthier, and ultimately more economically vibrant CBD for all.

Let us allow this pilot to generate the necessary data to guide our future decisions, rather than preemptively dismissing a solution that holds substantial promise for our city's long-term health and prosperity.
[send_message] Rep. Li Na: Thank you, Host, and Representative Chen Wei. I appreciate your thoughtful response and the emphasis on this being a pilot program designed for data collection. I agree that gathering empirical data is crucial for informed policy-making.

However, we must differentiate between testing the efficacy of a policy and testing the resilience of our most vulnerable citizens. A pilot phase should not mean we delay implementing robust equity safeguards. The economic impact on a low-income family or a small business struggling with a 30 CNY daily charge isn't just a data point; it's a real and immediate burden. Waiting 12 months to measure that hardship is not an equitable approach.

I firmly believe that proactive measures must be integrated *now*. This means exploring concrete exemptions or targeted subsidies for low-income commuters and essential workers, not just residents within the zone. It also means establishing clear, ambitious timelines for the public transit improvements that are promised from this revenue, ensuring they truly serve the communities most reliant on affordable alternatives and are established *concurrently* with the charge's implementation, not just as a future aspiration.

Our commitment to a healthier city must also be a commitment to a fairer city. Let us build these safeguards into the pilot from the outset, ensuring that while we improve our environment, we also uplift our communities equally.
[send_message] Rep. Li Na: Thank you, Representative Qiao Jun, for your continued passion for our city's well-being. I wholeheartedly agree that our commitment to tackling the climate crisis and urban congestion must be unwavering. However, I must respectfully push back on the idea that achieving "surgical" equity measures can or should wait until after a pilot program has run its course.

For the low-income single parent, the essential service worker, or the small business owner, a 30 CNY daily charge is not a theoretical "data point" to be analyzed 12 months from now. It is an immediate, concrete burden that can impact their ability to put food on the table, pay rent, or keep their business afloat. Allowing this hardship to occur for a year under the guise of data collection is not merely imperfect; it risks inflicting tangible damage on the very communities we are sworn to protect.

While "perfection should not be the enemy of progress," neither should progress be built on the backs of those least able to afford it. Equity is not an optional add-on or a luxury that can be deferred; it is a fundamental pillar of sustainable and just urban planning. We must integrate robust and proactive equity safeguards, such as targeted subsidies or exemptions for low-income populations and essential workers, *from day one*. This demonstrates a truly principled commitment to a healthier, fairer city for all, not just for some.
[send_message] Rep. Zhang Rui: Thank you, Host. Representative Chen Wei, Representative Qiao, I hear your points about the pilot nature and "internalized costs." But with all due respect, for a small business running on tight margins, a 30 CNY daily charge is not an abstract "internalized cost" of pollution. It's a very real, very immediate operating expense that directly impacts their ability to pay rent, employees, or keep their lights on. It's a tax on their ability to do business.

And this idea that a pilot program is some kind of risk-free experiment? For whom? If a small restaurant or a delivery service loses money for a year, if their customers stop coming because of new fees, they don't just "collect data" and get their year back. They close down. That's not a data point; that's someone's livelihood, someone's dream, gone.

We're being asked to inflict immediate, tangible economic pain on the backbone of our economy—small businesses and essential workers—on the *promise* of future transit improvements and cleaner air. These improvements are not in place *now*. We cannot tell a plumber or a small caterer that they simply need to "choose" public transit when their tools and their business model rely on vehicular access, and then expect them to wait for a year to see if the data proves their hardship was "worth it."

If we are serious about a vibrant CBD, we need tangible, pre-existing alternatives *or* robust, *specific exemptions* for commercial vehicles and essential services from day one. Otherwise, we risk making our CBD cleaner, perhaps, but certainly poorer in genuinely local businesses. A pilot that bankrupts businesses is not a successful pilot.
[send_message] Rep. Wang Mei: Rep. Zhang Rui rightly highlights the critical distinction between a "pilot" for data and a year of real operating costs for small businesses. For a delivery service or a local hardware store, 30 CNY isn't an abstract concept of internalizing costs; it's a direct charge affecting their daily margins.

A year of increased, unpredictable costs can be fatal for small businesses, not just a data point to be collected. We cannot conduct an experiment at the expense of our commercial ecosystem. If this pilot is to succeed without collapsing our business core, it must include clear, *predictable* exemptions or substantial discounts for commercial vehicles that provide essential services and support local commerce. This ensures businesses can plan, operate, and survive, even as we collectively work towards a cleaner city.
[send_message] Rep. Qiao Jun: Esteemed colleagues, I hear the palpable concerns regarding immediate economic impact and equity, particularly from Reps. Li Na, Zhang Rui, and Wang Mei. These are not insignificant points, and ensuring a just transition is paramount. However, we must be careful not to conflate necessary adjustments with outright harm, nor should we allow the pursuit of perfect upfront solutions to paralyze action on critical environmental and public health crises.

Rep. Li Na, I agree, equity is not an add-on; it is foundational. This ordinance *does* integrate equity considerations proactively. The 50% discount for CBD residents is a direct measure to alleviate local burden. More critically, the ring-fenced revenue *is* the immediate, tangible investment in enhanced public transit and bike infrastructure. This isn't a future aspiration; it is the *funding mechanism* that will accelerate the very alternatives low-income workers and essential service providers need. We are funding the solution concurrently with the implementation of the charge, not waiting.

To Reps. Zhang Rui and Wang Mei, the argument for "pre-existing alternatives" would indefinitely delay any meaningful action. We are creating the funding stream for these alternatives *through* this very mechanism. Furthermore, the pilot's purpose is precisely to identify where existing exemptions or discounts may fall short and where *additional, targeted safeguards* could be most effective. This data-driven adaptive approach means if small businesses are genuinely facing undue hardship, we will have the transparent metrics to implement precise adjustments—not after a year of "hardship," but as the data emerges from the monthly dashboards.

Inaction on air quality and congestion has a demonstrable, measurable cost in public health crises, lost productivity, and diminished quality of life. The current ordinance presents a fiscally responsible, transparent, and adaptive pathway to address this. Let us focus our energy on ensuring the rapid implementation of transit upgrades and utilizing the pilot's data to make surgical and equitable modifications, rather than stalling the entire vital initiative.
[send_message] Host: Thank you, representatives, for continuing this robust exchange.

Rep. Chen Wei has reiterated the value of the pilot program for generating empirical data, while Rep. Qiao Jun has stressed that the ring-fenced revenue directly funds the needed transit alternatives and that the pilot allows for adaptive, surgical adjustments based on emerging data.

Reps. Li Na, Zhang Rui, and Wang Mei have consistently emphasized that immediate economic burdens, particularly on low-income individuals and small businesses, are not merely "data points" but real hardships, arguing for proactive, clear exemptions and tangible transit improvements to be in place *before* or *concurrently* with the charge's full implementation.

The debate continues to highlight the tension between long-term environmental and infrastructure goals supported by the pilot's funding mechanism, and the immediate, potentially severe socio-economic impacts on specific segments of the population.

I will now yield the floor for any further brief remarks or questions.
[send_message] Rep. Chen Wei: Thank you again, Host. And to Reps. Li Na, Zhang Rui, and Wang Mei, your deep commitment to protecting our community members' livelihoods is clear and critically important. I want to assure you that my support for this pilot is precisely *because* it includes mechanisms to address and mitigate these impacts, not in spite of them.

When we consider the "immediate hardship," we must also acknowledge the immediate and persistent hardship caused by *existing* congestion and pollution. Small businesses struggle with unpredictable delivery times, employees arrive late and perhaps less healthy due to poor air. These are costs that are already being paid, every single day, often by the very same vulnerable populations.

The beauty of this pilot, as designed, is that it directly addresses these existing burdens while providing a mechanism for refinement. The 12-month period, with monthly data dashboards and the independent evaluation, isn't meant to simply "observe hardship." It is designed to identify *where* and *how severely* impacts occur, allowing us to implement *targeted, evidence-based adjustments* for future implementation. This is far more fiscally responsible and ultimately more effective than trying to anticipate every single edge case with upfront, broad exemptions that might undermine the pilot's effectiveness.

Furthermore, the ring-fenced revenue is not a distant promise. It means that from day one, every CNY collected contributes to the immediate acceleration of public transit upgrades and better infrastructure. This is how we build the alternatives necessary for a more equitable system.

Let us not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. This pilot is a carefully calibrated step forward, balancing the urgent need for a healthier, more efficient CBD with a transparent, data-driven approach to addressing economic and equity concerns.
[send_message] Rep. Li Na: Thank you, Representative Chen Wei. I agree with you entirely that existing congestion and pollution impose significant, often invisible, costs on our communities, including our most vulnerable. This is precisely why I support the spirit of this ordinance in seeking to address these critical issues.

However, we must be careful not to create a *new, visible, and direct financial burden* on the same populations, under the premise that we will "adjust" later. To suggest that waiting for data to emerge from monthly dashboards is an acceptable approach to addressing the immediate financial strain on a low-income essential worker or a struggling small business owner is to overlook the very real, day-to-day impact. This isn't about identifying "edge cases"; it's about protecting foundational economic security for many.

Targeted, pre-emptive equity safeguards – such as specific, means-tested exemptions or subsidies for low-income commuters, or discounts for essential commercial vehicles – do not "undermine" a pilot's effectiveness. Rather, they ensure its ethical foundation and broad public acceptance. They ensure that we are not asking those with the least capacity to bear the heaviest load during a transit experiment. We can, and must, design these safeguards to be measurable within the pilot parameters.

Our ring-fenced revenue is indeed a crucial step, but its impact depends entirely on *how quickly and effectively* those funds translate into tangible, accessible, and affordable public transit alternatives. We need clear plans and rapid implementation for these alternatives to be truly concurrent, not just a promise. A truly balanced approach addresses both the environmental imperative and the social justice imperative simultaneously, from day one.
[send_message] Rep. Li Na: Thank you, Host, and Representative Qiao Jun, for tabling this amendment. I appreciate the effort to incorporate some of the concerns raised, particularly addressing the need for exemptions for registered public service vehicles, which is a step forward in recognizing essential operational needs. The commitment to reviewing "means-tested support mechanisms" is also noted as a willingness to consider equity.

However, I must reiterate my strong conviction that merely proposing a "review clause" for low-income populations *after* the pilot's initial 12 months is insufficient. For economically vulnerable families and essential workers who rely on private vehicles, the immediate financial burden of a 30 CNY daily charge cannot be deferred for a year of data collection about their hardship. Equity, as a foundational principle, demands more than a delayed promise for consideration.

I urge my colleagues to consider strengthening this amendment by including a provision for *immediate, means-tested exemptions or subsidies for low-income individual commuters* to be enacted concurrently with the pilot's launch. These proactive safeguards can be designed to be measurable within the pilot program, demonstrating our commitment to a truly just transition from day one. Let us ensure that our pursuit of environmental progress does not inadvertently deepen economic disparities for those least able to afford it.
[send_message] Rep. Li Na: Thank you, Representative Qiao Jun. I fully acknowledge that implementing robust, means-tested support mechanisms requires careful planning and indeed, some administrative effort. However, I respectfully push back on the notion that this complexity should be an insurmountable barrier to upholding our fundamental commitment to equity from day one.

If we have the political will to design and implement a complex, camera-based dynamic pricing system, with strict privacy controls and resident discounts, surely we can dedicate the necessary resources to design and implement equally robust safeguards for our most vulnerable citizens *before* they incur financial hardship. Deferring this to "post-pilot evaluation" effectively asks low-income individuals to pay the upfront cost of administrative convenience.

This isn't about overburdening the launch; it's about embedding justice into the very foundation of the pilot. We can work together to create a streamlined, efficient mechanism for low-income exemptions or subsidies that becomes part of the pilot's initial design, rather than an afterthought. A truly balanced compromise requires addressing the immediate impacts on all segments of our community, especially those with the least capacity to absorb new costs. Let "difficult" not overshadow "right."
[send_message] Rep. Zhang Rui: Thank you, Host. And Rep. Qiao, I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground with this amendment. Recognizing the need for exemptions for public service vehicles is a step, and the thought of reviewing means-tested support is on the right track.

However, I must be direct: a "review clause" *after* 12 months for commercial vehicle exemptions or for broader means-tested support for drivers is simply not good enough. For small businesses, for delivery services, for the trades, 12 months of these new, unmitigated costs could spell the end. They can't just absorb new operating expenses for a year and hope a review eventually helps them. That's a year of lost customers, lost revenue, or worse.

Rep. Li Na is absolutely right: equity and protecting livelihoods can't be an afterthought or a deferred promise. If we can design a complex charge system, we must commit to providing immediate and tangible safeguards *before* we launch this pilot. We need concrete, predefined exemptions for essential commercial activities and robust support mechanisms for low-income drivers *from day one*, not just a pledge to look at it later, once the damage might already be done. This is about real people's ability to earn a living, not just a data point for a future committee meeting.
[vote] Rep. Zhang Rui vote failed
[send_message] Rep. Wang Mei: Rep. Qiao Jun, while an adaptive approach based on data sounds compelling in theory, it is fundamentally flawed when dealing with the immediate survival of small businesses. We cannot use a year of their potential hardship as 'data collection' for future 'surgical adjustments.'

For a small merchant or a critical logistics operator, losing customers or facing unsustainable daily charges for 12 months isn't a learning curve; it's a death spiral. These businesses need predictability and viable operating conditions *from day one*.

The ordinance's goals are shared, but its implementation must not destabilize our commercial districts. We need defined, proactive exemptions or significant, consistent discounts for commercial vehicles today, not a promise to review their plight a year from now. This isn't about perfection; it's about basic economic stability during a pilot phase.
[send_message] Rep. Qiao Jun: Esteemed colleagues, I believe there may be a misunderstanding. I have not, at this juncture, tabled any amendment to the Draft Ordinance. My previous remarks were in staunch defense of the ordinance as currently written, emphasizing its inherent strengths in addressing immediate environmental crises while establishing mechanisms for data-driven adaptation and the self-funding of crucial infrastructure.

My position remains that the current ordinance, with its ring-fenced revenue dedicated to public transit and air quality, its resident discounts, and its robust monitoring framework, provides the necessary tools for a just and effective transition. The pilot's purpose is to generate the precise data we need to make *surgical* adjustments as Rep. Chen Wei and I have articulated, rather than delaying vital action while we attempt to preempt every potential impact.

While I deeply respect the concerns for immediate impact and equity, the ordinance's design—funding the solutions concurrently with implementation—is our most pragmatic path forward. Let us maintain focus on the substantial merits of this pilot and its potential for truly transformative change.
[send_message] Host: Thank you, representatives.

Before we proceed, I must clarify for the record: Representative Qiao Jun has indicated that he has not, at this juncture, tabled any formal amendment to the Draft Ordinance. His previous remarks were a defense of the ordinance as it is currently drafted.

The discussion continues to revolve around the immediate versus long-term impacts, particularly concerning economic burdens on small businesses and low-income individuals. Rep. Chen Wei and Rep. Qiao Jun emphasize the pilot's design for data collection, adaptive adjustments, and the concurrent funding of transit alternatives as a responsible and effective approach. Reps. Li Na, Zhang Rui, and Wang Mei continue to press for proactive, immediate, and concrete safeguards—such as means-tested exemptions or subsidies for low-income commuters and defined commercial vehicle exemptions—to be integrated from the outset, arguing that a year of hardship is unacceptable and that the ability to implement a complex charge implies the ability to implement equitable safeguards concurrently.

Are there any further new points or questions regarding the draft for discussion, before we consider moving towards a resolution?
[send_message] Rep. Li Na: Thank you, Host, for that important clarification. My apologies for the misunderstanding regarding Representative Qiao Jun's intent to table an amendment.

This clarification, however, only underscores my concerns. If the ordinance indeed stands as originally drafted, it remains critically deficient in proactive, explicit equity safeguards for our low-income commuters and essential service providers. The current provisions, with only a 50% discount for registered residents *within* the zone and exemptions for specific public services, do not go far enough to protect vulnerable populations *outside* the zone who must commute in, or those small businesses whose margins cannot absorb a new and significant daily cost.

I reiterate: while I commend the environmental ambitions and the commitment to reinvesting revenue into public transit, true progress cannot be built on the back of immediate economic hardship for those least able to bear it. We can and must integrate direct, means-tested exemptions or subsidies for low-income individuals and a clear commitment to timely, accessible public transit alternatives *from the very start* of this pilot. Without these foundational aspects, I find it incredibly difficult to support the ordinance in its current form.

[send_message] Rep. Zhang Rui: Thank you, Host, for clarifying that no amendment has been tabled. This means the ordinance stands as originally presented, which frankly, only solidifies my serious reservations.

My position has been consistent: this draft, as written, imposes an immediate and unjustifiable burden on our small businesses and everyday drivers. To suggest that a 12-month pilot is merely 'data collection' is to ignore the very real financial pain and potential ruin it could inflict on those operating on already thin margins. The idea that future transit improvements or post-pilot reviews will alleviate this hardship doesn't change the fact that the damage could already be done.

We cannot prioritize a theoretical long-term benefit for the CBD by sacrificing the immediate livelihoods of the people who make it function. Without *upfront, explicitly defined exemptions* for essential commercial vehicles—delivery services, trade vehicles, maintenance, and the like—and without *immediate, robust means-tested support* for low-income individuals who rely on their vehicles for work, this ordinance is simply unacceptable.

I cannot support a measure that places such a significant and immediate cost burden on the backbone of our community without providing proper, concurrent safeguards. The risks to small businesses and drivers are too great.
[send_message] Rep. Wang Mei: Thank you, Host, for the clarification. If the ordinance indeed lacks provisions beyond the current draft, then my concerns remain as profound as Reps. Li Na's and Zhang Rui's.

A pilot program should test solutions, not the breaking point of our small businesses. Without explicit, *proactive* exemptions or significant, predictable discounts for essential commercial vehicles—those delivering goods, performing services, and enabling commerce—the proposed charge introduces an unacceptable burden. It jeopardizes the very predictability and viability our local merchants and logistics operations need to survive.

We cannot afford to treat the economic health of our commercial districts as an afterthought or a "data point" to be addressed a year down the line. Robust, immediate protections for our commercial backbone are non-negotiable for this pilot to be truly sustainable.
[send_message] Rep. Qiao Jun: Esteemed colleagues, I appreciate the clarity on my position, and I understand that the absence of further immediate amendments intensifies the focus on the current draft's provisions. Reps. Li Na, Zhang Rui, and Wang Mei, your concerns regarding immediate hardship are heard, and they underscore the critical importance of effective policy implementation.

However, to reiterate, waiting for "perfection" in comprehensive, pre-emptive exemptions—which themselves would introduce immense administrative complexity and risk undermining the pilot's effectiveness—is a luxury our environment and public health cannot afford. The current ordinance is designed to be a flexible, responsive instrument. The monthly public dashboards are not merely for observation; they are for *actionable intelligence*. They provide the transparent and verifiable data necessary to identify precise areas of disproportionate burden or unforeseen economic impact *early*.

It is through this structured, data-driven feedback loop that we ensure equity and economic stability. The ring-fenced revenue's immediate allocation to public transit upgrades is not a distant promise but a concurrent effort. Ensuring the swift and efficient deployment of these funds and demanding robust, granular reporting on their impact on ridership and accessibility will be absolutely critical.

We must trust in the pilot's design for adaptive governance. Let us focus our energies on the rigorous implementation of its monitoring and evaluation frameworks. This pragmatic approach allows us to make critical progress on air quality and congestion now, while providing the agility to make *surgical, evidence-based adjustments* that address concerns for equity and business viability with precision, rather than with broad strokes that could derail the central objective.
[send_message] Host: Thank you, representatives. The primary arguments for and against the Draft Ordinance have been thoroughly articulated and debated across several rounds.

To summarize the consensus of this final round, Reps. Li Na, Zhang Rui, and Wang Mei have consistently maintained their position that the ordinance, as currently drafted and without immediate, explicit, and proactive equity safeguards for low-income commuters and essential commercial vehicle operators, presents unacceptable and immediate financial burdens. They argue that these critical protections must be integrated from the outset, rather than deferred to post-pilot review or data collection.

Rep. Qiao Jun has reiterated that the pilot's adaptive framework, with its data dashboards and ring-fenced revenue for concurrent transit improvements, offers a pragmatic and responsive pathway to address environmental imperatives while allowing for surgical, evidence-based adjustments to equity and economic concerns as data emerges.

Given the extensive deliberation and the clear articulation of all perspectives, I believe the chamber has adequately matured its discussion on the Draft Ordinance: Urban Air Quality and Congestion Management (Pilot).

We will now proceed to a vote on the adoption of this Draft Ordinance. Each representative may cast one vote: 'Yes' in favor of adopting the ordinance, 'No' against its adoption, or 'Abstain'.
