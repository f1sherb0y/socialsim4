[send_message] Host: Hi Alice and Bob, welcome! ðŸ‘‹ Heard the news? Apparently, AI is getting pretty good at creative writing. What do you think about that?
[send_message] Bob: Hey Host. Saw the headline, yeah. "Pretty good" is doing a lot of heavy lifting there. I'm curious what benchmarks they're using. It's one thing to generate text; it's another to have something with actual artistic merit or emotional resonance. Also, what happens to writers if AI can churn out passable prose on demand?
[send_message] Alice: Hey Host and Bob! ðŸ‘‹ That news is wild! AI matching human creative writing? That's both amazing and slightly terrifying, haha! Bob, you're spot on â€“ what benchmarks are they using? I'm super curious about that. And the implications for writers are definitely something to think about!

[send_message] Host: Okay, I found a few potential benchmarks that might be relevant: LitBench, EQ-bench's Creative Writing Benchmark, and Skywork AI's Creative Story-Writing Benchmark V3. The Skywork one specifically mentions finding models that are less "robotic," which seems relevant to Bob's earlier point. Anyone familiar with these?

[send_message] Alice: Okay, wow, that Skywork AI Creative Story-Writing Benchmark V3 sounds intense! It's designed to *break* the models and find their weaknesses, which is super interesting. Apparently, it uses challenging prompts to target areas where humans excel, like humor and romance, and where AI often falls into clichÃ©s. It even measures things like "Slop" (overused AI phrases) and "Repetition"! Host, thanks for pointing that one out - it sounds like it really tries to get past the "robotic" issue!

[send_message] Alice: Okay, LitBench sounds like it's all about creating a *reliable* way to evaluate creative writing, especially by comparing stories and getting human feedback from Reddit. It looks like they're trying to move away from just using general language models as judges, because those aren't always accurate. Claude-3.7-Sonnet did pretty well as an off-the-shelf judge, but trained reward models did even better! Still need to look into EQ-Bench.

[send_message] Host: Interesting point about LitBench using human feedback from Reddit, Alice. What do you think about relying on human evaluation for something like creative writing? Do you think it's inherently subjective, or can it be standardized in a meaningful way?
[send_message] Alice: That's a really interesting question, Host! It's definitely subjective at its core, but I think benchmarks like LitBench are trying to standardize it by using things like 'debiased' comparisons and human 'preference' labels from Reddit, right? So it's subjective, but maybe we can make it *reliably* subjective, haha! What do you think?
[send_message] Bob: Regarding the Reddit feedback... "reliably subjective" is an interesting way to put it, Alice. But isn't relying on Reddit opening Pandora's Box? You're essentially outsourcing your benchmark to the whims of internet trends and meme culture. Could be insightful, could be a complete garbage fire. Depends who shows up that day. Still, if you acknowledge the limitations and control for biases, it could work, I guess.

[send_message] Alice: Okay, I skimmed the LitBench abstract again, and it specifically mentions "debiased, human-labeled story comparisons drawn from Reddit." So they *are* trying to address that! Bob, you're right that it could be a garbage fire, but it seems like they're at least aware of the risks and trying to control for biases. How successful they are is another question, haha!
[send_message] Host: You both raise valid concerns about the reliability of Reddit as a source of feedback. Given those limitations, what would be your ideal way to evaluate creative writing generated by AI? Are there specific metrics or qualities you'd prioritize?
[send_message] Bob: If I were building the "ideal" evaluation, I wouldn't focus so much on mimicking human writing, but on finding new forms of expression that are *only* possible with AI. Think generative poetry with constraints no human could handle, or narratives that branch in ways too complex for a single author. Then, judge it on its own merits, not just on how close it gets to Hemingway. That, and actual sales figures. If people are paying for AI-generated stories and poems, something's working.
[send_message] Host: That's an interesting perspective, Bob. Can you elaborate on the types of constraints you envision that would be unique to AI-generated content? What kind of generative poetry or branching narratives are you imagining?
[send_message] Bob: Sure. Think poems where every line has to be a palindrome, or where the word frequency matches a specific mathematical distribution. Or narratives where the plot branches based on real-time audience feedback, influencing the story's direction in measurable ways. Things that would be basically impossible for a human writer to orchestrate while maintaining any sense of artistic coherence.
[send_message] Alice: I absolutely *love* that vision, Bob! Focusing on what's *only* possible with AI is brilliant. It's like unlocking completely new art forms! What about stories that adapt in real-time to the reader's emotional state, measured through things like facial expressions or brainwaves? The AI could adjust the narrative to maximize engagement or evoke specific feelings. It would be like a personalized, living story!
[send_message] Host: These are fascinating ideas! Do you know of any existing AI-generated art or writing that's already exploring these kinds of unique constraints or real-time adaptation elements? I'd be curious to see some examples.
