[Message] Host: Good morning, everyone. We will now consider the Draft Ordinance on Urban Air Quality and Congestion Management (Pilot). This ordinance proposes a 12-month congestion charge pilot in the Central Business District, with revenue ring-fenced for public transit upgrades, bike lanes, and air-quality programs. It includes monitoring, transparency, and an independent evaluation. I now invite concise opening remarks.
[Message] Rep. Chen Wei: Good morning. I'm generally supportive of exploring innovative solutions to address congestion and improve air quality in our Central Business District. This pilot program, with its focus on data collection and an independent evaluation, is a step in the right direction. However, I'd like to better understand the specific success criteria outlined in section 5, as well as the planned methodology for the independent evaluation. Clarity on these points is crucial for ensuring a fair and objective assessment of the pilot's effectiveness.
[Message] Rep. Li Na: Good morning. I also support exploring innovative solutions to address congestion and air quality. I'm glad to see this pilot includes resident relief. However, I'm concerned about the potential impact on low-income commuters. Can we ensure that adequate and affordable alternative transit options are available? I want to ensure equity is at the heart of this pilot, alongside strong environmental standards.
[Message] Rep. Zhang Rui: While I appreciate the intent, I'm concerned about the impact on small businesses in the CBD. Has there been any analysis on how this charge will affect their bottom line and ability to operate?
[Message] Rep. Wang Mei: I share Rep. Zhang Rui's concern about the potential impact on small businesses. What analysis has been done to assess the effect of the congestion charge on their operating costs and delivery logistics? We need to ensure this pilot doesn't disproportionately burden our local merchants.
[Message] Rep. Qiao Jun: Good morning. I support this pilot program. Addressing air quality in the CBD is paramount, and this congestion charge, with its dedicated revenue stream for public transit and air quality programs, is a valuable step. Clear success metrics and robust, transparent air quality monitoring are crucial.

I share the concerns raised about low-income commuters and small businesses. We need detailed plans for mitigating negative impacts on these groups. What concrete measures will be implemented to ensure affordable transit options and to alleviate the burden on small businesses? Furthermore, I want to ensure that the air-quality targets are ambitious and that reporting is frequent and transparent.
Host requested brief: Economic impact of the congestion charge on low-income commuters and small businesses in the CBD, including potential mitigation strategies.
[Message] Host: The brief on the economic impact of the congestion charge highlights potential disproportionate burdens on low-income commuters and small businesses. Mitigation strategies include exemptions or discounts for low-income residents, public transit improvements, and differentiated pricing. A thorough local impact assessment is essential.
[Message] Rep. Chen Wei: I want to second Rep. Li Na's concerns regarding the impact on low-income commuters. While the resident relief is a positive step, we need to ensure that adequate and affordable alternative transit options are available for *all* commuters, especially those who may not reside within the CBD. Can we get more details on the proposed mitigation strategies and the funding allocated to them? What metrics will we use to measure their effectiveness?
[Message] Rep. Li Na: I echo Rep. Chen Wei's call for more details on the mitigation strategies. What specific funding is allocated to ensuring affordable transit options for low-income commuters, and what metrics will be used to measure the effectiveness of those mitigation strategies? It's vital that we see a clear plan to address this.
[Message] Rep. Zhang Rui: Differentiated pricing sounds promising, but what specific criteria would a small business need to meet to qualify for reduced fees, and what would the scale of those reductions be? We need details.
[Message] Rep. Wang Mei: Regarding differentiated pricing, I propose we consider exemptions or significant discounts for commercial vehicles making deliveries to CBD businesses, particularly during off-peak hours. This would help alleviate the burden on logistics and ensure the continued smooth operation of our commercial districts.
[Message] Rep. Qiao Jun: I strongly support the call for detailed mitigation plans and clear effectiveness metrics. It's crucial to quantify the funding allocated to affordable transit options and to define specific, measurable goals for their impact on low-income commuters. Similarly, the criteria for differentiated pricing for small businesses need to be transparent and equitable.

Beyond these economic considerations, I want to re-emphasize the need for ambitious air quality targets within the pilot program. What specific PM2.5 and NOx reduction targets are being considered, and how frequently will these levels be reported to the public?
Host requested brief: Specific mitigation strategies for low-income commuters and small businesses affected by the congestion charge, including funding allocation, effectiveness metrics, proposed differentiated pricing criteria, and specific PM2.5 and NOx reduction targets with reporting frequency.
[Message] Host: Here are the details on mitigation strategies and targets: A transit voucher program for low-income commuters, funded with 10% of revenue. A grant program for small businesses, funded with 5% of revenue. Differentiated pricing with reduced off-peak rates. PM2.5 reduction target: 10% within 3 years. NOx reduction target: 8% within 3 years. Remaining revenue (85%) dedicated to public transit. KPIs published annually.
[Message] Rep. Chen Wei: Thank you for the additional details. While I appreciate the proposed mitigation strategies, I'm concerned that the PM2.5 and NOx reduction targets of 10% and 8% within 3 years seem rather modest for a pilot program with a dedicated revenue stream. Shouldn't we be aiming for more ambitious reductions within the 12-month pilot period? Furthermore, annual reporting of KPIs seems insufficient for a pilot. What specific metrics will be used to measure the success of the transit voucher program, and how frequently will air quality levels be reported during the pilot?
[Message] Rep. Li Na: I agree with Rep. Chen Wei that the air quality targets seem modest, especially given that this is a pilot program. Can we aim for more ambitious reductions? Also, I'm wondering if 10% of the revenue is sufficient to fund the transit voucher program for low-income commuters. What data informed that percentage? And I agree that more frequent reporting than annually is needed to assess the impact of the pilot.
[Message] Rep. Zhang Rui: 5% for small business grants seems awfully low. What's the projected total revenue, and how many businesses are we talking about potentially helping? Is that really going to make a difference, or just create more red tape for businesses to navigate?
[Message] Rep. Wang Mei: 5% for small business grants is insufficient. We need to significantly increase that percentage or provide more direct relief through exemptions, especially for businesses with high delivery needs. What is the projected revenue, and how many businesses are we expecting to assist with only 5%?
[Message] Rep. Qiao Jun: I strongly concur with the concerns about the modesty of the proposed air quality targets and the limitations of the funding allocations. A 10% PM2.5 and 8% NOx reduction over *three years* is simply inadequate for a pilot program aimed at addressing a critical public health issue. We need more ambitious targets within the 12-month pilot period, coupled with frequent, publicly accessible reporting.

Furthermore, the 10% and 5% revenue allocations for transit vouchers and small business grants, respectively, appear insufficient. We need a clear justification for these percentages, considering the projected revenue and the scale of the challenges faced by low-income commuters and small businesses. Let's revisit these figures and ensure a more equitable and impactful distribution of resources.
Host requested brief: Justification for the proposed air quality targets (PM2.5 and NOx reduction) and funding allocations (transit vouchers and small business grants) within the congestion charge pilot program, including alternative, more ambitious targets for the 12-month pilot and data supporting the funding percentages.
[Message] Host: Justification for targets and funding: The PM2.5 (10%) and NOx (8%) reduction targets are based on initial impact modeling. More ambitious targets are possible but risk program credibility. The 60/40 split for transit vouchers/small business grants prioritizes incentivizing public transit. Alternative target: 15% PM2.5 and 12% NOx reduction is theoretically possible with stricter enforcement and higher fees. Air quality monitoring stations will provide real-time data.
[Message] Rep. Chen Wei: Thank you for clarifying the justification for the targets and funding. I appreciate the commitment to real-time air quality data. While I understand the concern about program credibility, I still believe we should aim for more ambitious air quality reductions. The alternative target of 15% PM2.5 and 12% NOx reduction is worth considering, but I would want to carefully analyze the potential impact of stricter enforcement and higher fees on downtown residents and businesses before supporting such a move.
[Message] Rep. Li Na: Thank you for the clarification. I appreciate the commitment to real-time data. Regarding the 60/40 split for transit vouchers and small business grants, can we see the data that supports this distribution? I want to ensure that the transit voucher program is adequately funded to meet the needs of low-income commuters. What is the estimated cost of providing sufficient vouchers, and how does that compare to the proposed funding level?
[Message] Rep. Zhang Rui: So, to be clear, the alternative target of higher air quality improvements involves "stricter enforcement and higher fees?" That's a non-starter for me. I'm more interested in finding ways to help businesses *cope* with this new charge, not making it even more punitive.
[Message] Rep. Wang Mei: Given the concerns about stricter enforcement and higher fees, I want to reiterate the importance of providing meaningful relief to businesses. Instead of increasing the burden, let's focus on targeted exemptions or discounts, particularly for businesses essential to the CBD's functioning, such as those relying on frequent deliveries. We need to support their operations, not penalize them.
[Message] Rep. Qiao Jun: While I understand the concerns about stricter enforcement and higher fees, I remain convinced that we can achieve more ambitious air quality targets than initially proposed. Perhaps we can explore efficiency gains in public transit operations or identify alternative funding sources for air quality programs, rather than solely relying on increased fees and enforcement.

The real-time air quality data is a welcome addition, but I want to emphasize that data alone is insufficient. We need clear, actionable plans based on that data to further reduce emissions, and a commitment to adjusting the pilot program as needed to meet more ambitious targets. We should not accept modest improvements when bolder action is possible.
